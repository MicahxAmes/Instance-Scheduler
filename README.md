Serverless EC2 Instance Scheduler for Company Working Hours

The Serverless EC2 Instance Scheduler for Company Working Hours project aims to optimize the operational costs of EC2 instances by ensuring they run only during specified working hours. This is achieved by implementing two AWS Lambda functions that start and stop the instances at designated times. These functions are triggered by CloudWatch Events, making the solution fully serverless and automated. The primary goal is to provide a cost-effective and efficient way to manage EC2 instance uptime based on company working hours, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM
